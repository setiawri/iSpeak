TO DO:
- troubleshoot:
	> cancel invoice shows error:
		1. bad request from wrong domain: i-speak.co
		2. error because session is not yet cancelled. not showing error message.
- payroll payment page: year box in month filter should be next to the month
- check for log links that should not be seen by some roles. e.g.: student should not see log for lesson sessions because there is information about hourly rates, etc.
- navigation menu: for students, do not show menu Sales. maybe create a new one just for students?
- tutors can only see their payroll information. related to settings value can only see own data
- trim useraccounts name on edit/add
- UserAccounts controller: method get(). fix issues regarding branches_id and branches
- Sale Invoices index: add link to user accounts page for student and tutor. Change tutor name to only first name
- SaleInvoiceItemsModel: remove field Due and calculate on the fly. Calculation is done and put into DueAmount. Need to implement this everywhere
